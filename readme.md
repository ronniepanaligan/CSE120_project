# CSE 120 Project
developed by Ronnie Panaligan, Wesley Chen & Vardhan Solanki for CSE 120 at UC Merced

## What are we Creating?
We are redesigning the class registration system at UC Merced by including a better way to register for classes besides refreshing the add/drop a class page seconds before a student's registration time hoping their desired classes haven't filled up yet.

## To-Do
- [ ] Update frontend
- [ ] implement some sort of queue for automatic registration
- [ ] add classes to main database hosted on heroku
- [ ] complete schedule system
- [ ] implement a function to check if user has no conflictions when registering

There is currently no authentication so navigate to https://cse120-project.herokuapp.com/home to skip the login screen. Will fix eventually.
